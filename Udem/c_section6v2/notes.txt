Variables and Constants

what is a variable- is abstraction for a memory location. allows programmers to use meaningful names and not memory addresses.

delcare and initializing variables

variableType variableName;

ex
int age;
double rate;
string name;

ex with custom types:
Account franks_account;
Person james;

primiative data types
integer, character, floating-point, Boolean

type sizes are expressed in bits

char - one byte, 8 buts
char16_t - 16 bits
char32_t - 32 bits
wchar_t - largest available character set

integer types
short int , int - 16 bits
long int - 32
long long int - 64

unsigned version used for 0 and positive integers
type
float, double, long double
size
7,15,19 repectively

type bool - true false

char uses single quote not double quotes for single character.

sizeof- an operator which determines the size in byte if a type of variable

Constants

what is it -have names, occupy storage, are usually typed.

their value cannot change once declared!

literal constants- such as x = 12, y = 1.56, name = "Frank"

declared constants - const keyword
const double pi {3.145926}

defined constants - #define pi 3.145926
uses preprocessor not used in modern c++

constant expressions - constexpr keyword

enumerated constants- enum keyword

defined constants - #define
