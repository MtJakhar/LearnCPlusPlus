the main function

Every c++ program need 1 main function

return 0 indicates successful program execution

name spaces
example std::cout
why std::cout vs cout- this prevents naming conflicts

:: is a scope resolution operator

when
using namespace std;
it allows you to replace std::cout to cout. may still cause naming issues in larger programs.
