statements and operators

Expressions and statements
expression- most basic building block of a program
-sequence of operators and operands that specifies a computation

-   computes a value from a number of operands

examples

-   34 a literal
-   favorite_number a variable
-   addition \*
-   multiplication \*
-   relational <,>
-   assignment =

statements

-   a complete line of code that performs some action
-   usually terminated with a semi-colon
-   usually contain expressions
-   C++ has many types of statements

operators
three types
-unary, binary, ternary
-assignment =

arithmetic operators

-   -   / \* %

increment and decrement operator
++ --,
adds or subtract by 1

mixed type expressions

C++ operations occur on the same type of operands

if operands are of different types, C++ will convert one

Important since it could affect caluculations results

C++ will attempt to automatically convert types, if it cant a compiler error will occur

conversions
higher vs lower
long double > double > flaot

promotion conversion to higher type
demotion conversion to a lower type
