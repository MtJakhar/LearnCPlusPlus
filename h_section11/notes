Functions

What is a function?
functions allow the modularization of a program
most functions are in C++, and third party libraries
You can create your own functions

write your code to the function specification

c++ has many libraries
ex:
cmath- which has common math calculations

defining functions

name- be meaningful
parameter list- variables passed into the functions

return type- the type of the data that is returned from the function

body- the statements that are executed when the function is called

syntax example

int would be return type
int function_name () {
statement(s);
return 0;
}

void return type
void function_name () {
statements(s);
return; //optional
}

calling functions
FUNCTIONS MUST BE DECLARED BEFORE THEY ARE CALLED
